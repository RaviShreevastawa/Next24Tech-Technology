      <b>1. Dog Breed Classification</b><br></br>
      <p className=' pl-4'>
        My dog breed classification program is a sophisticated machine learning project that leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify dog breeds from images. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of dog images, encompassing a wide variety of breeds. The system employs data augmentation strategies, such as rotation and zoom, to enhance the model's robustness and accuracy.

      <b>2. Blood Donation Website</b><br></br>
      <p className=' pl-4'>
      My blood donation website program is a dedicated platform designed to streamline the process of connecting blood donors with those in need. This web-based application features a user-friendly interface where potential donors can easily register, update their availability, and find nearby donation drives or hospitals. The system also includes a robust matching algorithm that pairs donors with patients based on blood type, location, and urgency of need, ensuring efficient and timely donations. Additionally, the website provides educational resources on the importance of blood donation and maintains a secure database to protect user information.
